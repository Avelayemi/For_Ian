                <p>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I hope you're having a great day, Ian. It's already been six months since we started to become friends. I just wanted to write this to say thank YOU - for allowing me to get to know you, even though we rarely talked much. You might not even remember when it all started, but that’s okay.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; It's been a fun time that I've got to share with you - whether we're joking around, staying quietly for a long time, or just talking about this & that. You can be pretty dry & reserved sometimes, but that is understandable since we rarely get to know each other. Still, I'm happy that we’ve got to spend some enjoyable moments together. It's been fun!
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; Again, I appreciate everything that you've shared with me, letting me get to know you, and allowing me to be your friend. You're a cool guy, Ian.
                    </span>
                </p>
